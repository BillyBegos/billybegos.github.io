<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">Hey, I'm Billy. I'm a Sophomore Computer Engineering undergrad, and I've had some fun making a few websites before for my high school, and this one is no different.</p>
<div style="height: 50px;">

<dl class="" style="color: white">
  <dt>Where am I from?*</dt>
  <dd>I'm from Norwalk Connecticut, a beautiful city on Long Island Sound. Below is a nice photo I took of the area</dd>
  <dt>What have I made before?</dt>
  <dd>For 3 years during high school I made websites for my schools drama department. The first year I used a website building service, but the last 2 years I created them myself, using bootstrap (mainly for the grid)</dd>
  <dd>I've also helped transitiion client's websites from outdated wordpress templates to more modern ones to increase backend ease of use</dd>
  <dt>Whats your favorite website?</dt>
  <dd>My favorite website (in the general relm of web dev) is <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/" target="_blank">colorhexa.com</a>. It's really nice for finding nice colors to use for text/buttons/backgrounds, and it gives you a lot of options for triadic and tetradic colors</dd>
