<h1>Photo Gallery</h1>
<p style="color: white; text-size: 100px">Here are some of the photos I took last year of Madison with my DJI Mavic 2 Zoom. I edited them using Microsoft ICE and lightroom, and have printed a few to put up around my room. The biggest
challenge for me in taking these was really only how incredibly cold I was while doing it. On websites I've done in the past I would always compress my images so they would load faster, although I didn't get around do doing that here, so it might take the images a hot minute to fully load,
as it is doing so even just loading the local file on my computer.</p>
